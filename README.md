**Browse It** is a lightweight and intuitive browser app designed specifically for watchOS. It allows users to quickly open popular websites and services directly from their Apple Watch.

I have based this project on this Reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/rcn2h7/comment/hnwr8do/ which explains how to exploit `ASWebAuthenticationSession` to open a website in the built-in watchOS browser
```swift
import AuthenticationServices

guard let url = URL(string: "https://apple.com") else { return }
let session = ASWebAuthenticationSession(url: url, callbackURLScheme: "") { _, _ in }
session.start()
```

## Features

- üåê Launch websites from categorized lists like:
  - Tech & Electronics
  - Social Media
  - Streaming & Entertainment
  - Shopping & Marketplaces
  - Education & Research
  - News & Media
  - Email & Cloud
  - Travel & Maps
  - Utilities & Tools

- üîó Custom URL support: Enter any URL you want and open it on demand.

- üß≠ Fully coded in SwiftUI.

## Notes

- Due to the limitations of watchOS, you can't open the keyboard to fill a textfiled inside a website.
- Cookies won't be stored.
- Custom URLs must be entered without https:// (e.g., enter example.com).
